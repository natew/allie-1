    BRIEF: We need a basic interface that displays our goals!

    PART 1: Implement the basic framework for our goal app

    TODO:

      CSS:
      - We want a consistent looking page
        - Download normalize.css and add it to this folder
        - Add normalize.css to our head so it styles our page

      HTML:
      - Change the title for our goals app
      - Have an field where we can type in a new goal
      - Have a button to "Add Goal"
      - Display a pre-populated list of some goals as an example
        - Each goal should have a check box next to it

      JS:
      - When we press the "Add Goal" button, alert() us the goal
      - When we press a checkbox, alert() us the goal next to the checkbox
        - Hint: Give each of your goal elements an ID. This will allow
          you to easily get their value. Your checkboxes will have a
          function they call and pass in the ID of the goal they are next to.
          Then the function will use that ID to get the value and alert.

    BONUS:
      - Implement some styles to:
        - Make our goals list centered on the page
        - Put the add goal input and button in a box
          - Make them look nice using border, background, and font
      - REFACTOR: Instead of using onClick in your HTML, try to put your
        javascript inside a separate file and include it with a <script>
        tag. Then, use look up and use window.onload in your javascript
        file and try to attach events to your button and checkboxes.
